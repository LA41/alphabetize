# alphabetize
During CS50, Harvard's online computer science course, I came accross some words I've been unfamiliar with. I created txt file to note all those words and their translations in Polish, my mother tongue. One day I thought 'hey, wouldn't it be nice, if those words were sorted, so I can just easily locate where it is?' (sure I could just use ctrl+f, but that would be less cool than writing little app).

So I did some research, and made a quick app to alphabetize all of words that are in file!
